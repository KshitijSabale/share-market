# share-market
This App uses the yahoo API which returns real time current Price of Shares present in the CSV file . 
Then compares it with the long-term and short-term Stop Loss Price as well as long-term and short-term  Break Out Prices 
and give real time notification on the PC as well as send message to telegram Group . 
To send message to telegram group I have used Telegram API to make the bot .
